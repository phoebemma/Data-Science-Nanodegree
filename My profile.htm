<p> I cannot remember exactly when my interest in data science started, but I remember I started my blog <a href="http://www.theinformedmum.org/"> The Informed Mum </a> in 2015 shortly after I had my first child. It was originally meant to address some of the misconceptions and myths related to motherhood and childcare in my part of Nigeria. It slowly metamorphosed into a maternal and child health advocacy blog.  During content development, I learnt HTML and some CSS.
</p>

<p> In 2017, I started Python courses, first at <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/"> CodeAcademy</a> and later at <a href ="https://www.udacity.com/"> Udacity </a> where I moved beyond Python to R. I have since been a part of almost every free coding bootcamp I came across. I have also gained earned a couple of programming/machine learning scholarships.
</p>

<p> At present, I am enrolled in a PhD program where I am working towards building and optimising machine learning models. This html script is a way for me to dust up my html and css skills and probably add some Javascript as well. From my mainly amateaur point of view, data science needs a good dose of <ul>
 <li>Interest in data science</li>
<li> Curiosity </li>
<li> Patience</li>
<li> Humility and the ability to accept that your codes can be horrible</li>
<li> And for female data scientists; confidence in yourself as you will meet people who think Data Science is too tough for persons with XX chromosomes </li>

</ul>
